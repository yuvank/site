This is my first **real** post.

My site has the basics right now.

I have deployed the site in Netlify and now it deploys from the latest GitHub commits. 

## Static generators

They are very minimal and fast. They look good too.

But my first foray into them was not as easy as I heard about them. Many of them required some basics of liquid, graphql, etc. The tutorials I saw made it even more complicated. 

I faced some minor issues while trying 11ty and Gatsby. Hugo worked out of the box. It also seemed fast. I love this theme.

## Deployment

Earlier, I manually deployed the website. But I soon realized how different it is from Wordpress. You just login and start writing when you use those CMS. 
Here you actually need to deploy and manage things. So, I just made use of GitHub and Netlify for CI/CD.

## Future of this blog

I am unsure about the licensing for the articles.

It is easier to do things and document them than to say I knew these things one time and I was able to do them. 

For example: I configured Nextcloud on a VPS by following some tutorials.
