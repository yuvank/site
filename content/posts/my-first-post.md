This is my first **real** post.

My site has the basics right now.

I have deployed the site in Netlify and now it deploys from the latest GitHub commits. 

## Static generators

It looks nice. I have heard how easy static site generators are, etc.

But my first foray into them was not that easy or interesting. Many of them required some basics of liquid, graphql, etc. Maybe the ones I tried only had these requirements. I think it is more that the tutorials I found could have made it more complicated. 

I faced some minor issues in 11ty and Gatsby. I am sure about Elventy. But I have no idea if the other generator was Gatsby. Hugo worked out of the box. It also seemed fast. I also really like this theme. 

## Deployment

I first manually deployed the website. But i think I realized how different it would be from wordpress, etc. You just login and start writing when you use those. Here you actually need to deploy and manage things. 

Now I have deployed it properly in Netlify. This is just much easier.

## Unsure of what to do

Also, mainly I was unsure of what to put here. I had ideas. A blog in a subdomain. But the reality is anything is better than thinking about it. 

I am unsure about the licensing for the articles.

And especially it is much easier to do things and document them. Than just say I knew these things one time and I did them. 

For example: I created a Nextcloud in a LAMP stack by following tutorials. But I couldn't make the SSL certificate to work properly. So, I just removed it instead of having an insecure cloud storage. I have a Minecraft server. I patched the log4j, I mean I just updated things. 

Markdown is easier to write. It is also getting much more popular than others like org-mode, etc.
